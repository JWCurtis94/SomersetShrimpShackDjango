# Client Issues Resolution Report

## Somerset Shrimp Shack - Critical Issues Fixed
**Date:** July 21, 2025

### Issues Reported by Client
1. **Stock doesn't count down after purchases**
2. **Stock management page doesn't show every product and categories don't work**  
3. **No notification or email to tell me when orders come through**

---

### Root Cause Analysis

#### Primary Issue: Empty Database
The main cause of all three reported issues was that the database was completely empty:
- **0 categories** 
- **0 products**
- **0 orders**

This explained why:
- Stock couldn't count down (no products existed)
- Stock management page showed nothing (no products to display)
- No email notifications (no orders to notify about)

#### Secondary Issue: Email Template Compatibility
The email notification system had compatibility issues with the current Order model structure.

### Solutions Implemented
