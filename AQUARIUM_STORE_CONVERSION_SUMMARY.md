## ⚙️ Technical Implementation

### Files Modified:
1. **`store/cart.py`** - Updated shipping logic for aquarium context
2. **`store/tests/test_cart.py`** - Updated tests for new shipping costs
3. **`setup_aquarium_store_data.py`** - Created proper aquarium product data

### Shipping Logic Updates:
```python
# Aquarium Shop Shipping Rules
if has_live_animals:
    return Decimal('12.00')  # Live animal shipping (temperature controlled)
else:
    return Decimal('6.00')   # Standard shipping (plants, food, equipment)
```

### Product Detection Logic:
The existing `is_shrimp_product` method already correctly identifies:
- Live aquarium animals (shrimp, snails, fish)
- Excludes food items that might contain animal terms
- Properly categorizes live vs non-live products

---
