                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <p>
                        Somerset Shrimp Shack began in 2024 with a simple passion: to share the stunning 
                        beauty of freshwater shrimp with fellow hobbyists across the UK. What started as 
                        a small personal collection quickly grew into something much bigger.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Founded by Emerzon Fitzgerald, our business 
                        is dedicated to providing healthy, vibrant shrimp and plants from ethically managed 
                        tanks. We believe that aquarium keeping should be sustainable, educational, 
                        and bring joy to hobbyists of all experience levels.
